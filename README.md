When Taavet Hinrikus moved to London from Estonia in 2006 he was constanstly frustrated each time he tried to make a money transfer between his home country and the UK. In his words " most of the charge was hidden in the exchange rate. The banks try hard to make it extremely difficult to understand what you’re paying for. There is no transparency in the market". This lack of transparency and frustration was what motivated the foundation of TransferWise, now know as Wise.

## Landscape:
The field of personal finance has suffered several changes in the last few years. After the Covid pandemic on 2020, the need of automation and reduction of human capital necesary for operations was made aparent. The focus on data analisis in order to make decisions such as approve or reject a credit aplication, identity verification and other tasks than usually need a person to transact are getting replaced by algorithms and AI systems. One of those services is the transfer of money in and offshore.

Wise FinTech domain can be clasified as Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking. As stated previously, Wise is not a bankin institution, althogh provide services such as savings accounts, it does not offer loans or credits of any kind.

Other major companies in this domain include Paypal and Western Union, but generally Wise offers more transparency and lower fees compared to them.

Although in Europe Wise is regarded as one of if not the company of choice to do international transfers, in emergent markets such as Asia-Pacific there are companies such as Alibaba and Tencent that offer similar services that compete with Wise.

## Results:

Wise keeps working constantly on ways to improve their business model and the results speak for themselves. As mentioned before, the company has aquired more than 16 million users and on average welcomes around 100k new users every week.

From their first year of service in 2012 in where the transactions through them amounted to 10 million euros to now a days of moving billions per quarter, Wise has come a long way.

In their anual report of 2023, Wise reported a revenue of 846.1 million british pounds.

The main metric that can be use to mesure the success of any aplication is the user base count and the amount of activity in the same, both fields in where Wise has passed with flying colors.

## Recomentations:

Because Wise moves capital from one place to another and already have the confidence of their users regarding the management, they should consider branching to the investment sector. Although Wise offer the ability to buy digital currencies, they do it via platforms like eToro and not directly. They have the oportunity to become a broker and increase the atracivenes and range of possible customers, therefore increasing their reach in all markets. The security measures are already in place and their accounts are already insured by the FDIC. The only hurdle left would be regulatory issues and creating the investment platform itself. But the biggest obstacle that any company faces they already have it sorted: its clients.
